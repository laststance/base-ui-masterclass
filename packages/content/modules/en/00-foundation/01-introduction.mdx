# What is a Headless UI Library?

A **headless UI library** provides the behavior and accessibility of UI components without any visual styling. Think of it as the skeleton of a component — all the logic, keyboard interactions, and ARIA attributes are handled for you, but the CSS is entirely yours.

## Styled vs. Headless

| Feature | Styled (Material UI) | Headless (Base UI) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Visual design | Pre-built | You decide |
| CSS control | Override/theme | Full ownership |
| Bundle size | Larger (CSS included) | Minimal |
| Flexibility | Limited by theme | Unlimited |

## What You'll Build

In this course, you'll rebuild **all 35 Base UI components** from scratch:

- Primitives: Button, Input, Separator
- State management: Switch, Toggle, Checkbox
- Forms: Field, Fieldset, Radio, Select
- Overlays: Dialog, Popover, Tooltip, Menu
- Advanced: Slider, ScrollArea, Toast
- And more...

By the end, you'll have a **publishable npm package** — your own headless UI library.

## Prerequisites

- Solid React knowledge (hooks, context, refs)
- TypeScript fundamentals (generics, utility types)
- Basic understanding of HTML semantics and ARIA
